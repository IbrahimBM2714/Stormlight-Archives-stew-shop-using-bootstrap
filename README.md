Stormlight Archives is an epic fantasy book series created by Brandon Sanderson.

This website was created using Bootstrap.

I wanted to use my newly acquired knowledge of Bootstrap and I had recently read the series so I thought of merging the two.

This is a fun project of how I imagined the characters of the series would have created a stew-selling website. 

**some instructions**
This website is purely made on html and css. So, if you want to run this on vs code, you need to download the "live server extension". After doing so you would see:

Go Live on the bottom right-hand side of your vscode screen. Click on it and the website will open in your browser.
